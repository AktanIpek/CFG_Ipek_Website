          <p>I'm Ipek, 24 years old girl from Turkey who has a profound interest in Rare Diseases and Web development. I studied Genetics and Bioengineering at Istanbul Bilgi University. I first met with programming in the first year of my bachelor's degree in the "Algorithms and Programming" course and I've started to learn Java. It was quite difficult but fun experience for someone who has never really practiced programming before.</p>
          <p>I finished my masters Bioinformatics at UPF, Barcelona and now, I am trying to change my career to become front end engineer!</p>
